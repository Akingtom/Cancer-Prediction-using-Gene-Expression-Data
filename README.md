# Cancer-Prediction-using-Gene-Expression-Data
This project implements machine learning models to predict cancer types based on RNA-seq gene expression data. The system analyzes gene expression patterns to classify samples into five different cancer categories with high accuracy.

Dataset

The dataset contains RNA-seq gene expression values for different cancer types:

BRCA (Breast Cancer)
KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma)
COAD (Colon Adenocarcinoma)
LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma)
PRAD (Prostate Adenocarcinoma)
